# Helper_For_Adding_UGACS_Classes

An easy program for helping graduate students 
in UGA computer science department view and 
add their classes by crawling courses' information
from official website.

I never actually try but I think this should also suit for 
other degrees or departments courses by assuming they have
similar formats with 'https://cs.uga.edu/courses/graduate'.

To run: 

    1. pip install requests_html
    2. python find.py
